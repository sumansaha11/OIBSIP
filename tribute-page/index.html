                    captivity. He later refines the suit to protect the world as Iron Man. Stark was known for his quick
                    wit, flamboyant personality, and complex character arc, which explores themes of redemption,

                    Endgame, he uses the Infinity Stones to erase Thanos and his army, knowing it will be fatal. The
                    immense power of the stones was too much for him to withstand, and he dies surrounded by his
                    friends, with his last words being,
